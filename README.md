### 👋 About me

I'm an Economics student at **Insper** passionate about using data, statistics, and code to understand financial markets and real-world problems.

My main interests are:

- 📈 **Quantitative Finance** – pricing, trading strategies, portfolio optimization, risk
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling** – from classical models to more complex pipelines
- 🧠 **Natural Language Processing** – extracting information from unstructured text
- 🌍 **Geospatial Analysis** – using geographic data (QGIS) to support economic decisions

Right now I'm building a portfolio of projects from my coursework and personal studies, focusing on **clean code, reproducible analysis, and clear documentation**.

### 🎯 What I’m working on

- Final projects for:
  - **Algorithmic Trading**
  - **Quantitative Finance**
  - **Machine Learning**
  - **Predictive Modeling**
  - **Georeferenced Information (QGIS)**
- Developing my **undergraduate thesis** using **ABIDES** for market microstructure simulation (code coming soon).
